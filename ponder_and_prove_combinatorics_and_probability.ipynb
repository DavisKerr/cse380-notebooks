So there's a 100% chance of choosing a green marble from the first barrel, and a 50% chance of choosing either color in the second barrel. You reach into one of the barrels (it's dark so you don't know which one) and select a marble at random. It's green. You select another. It's green too. You select a third, a fourth, a fifth, etc. Green each time. What is the *minimum* number of marbles you need to select to *exceed* a probability of 99% that you are picking them out of the all-green barrel?
