I found that while all of the ideas conveyed in Brother Bessey's paper were easy to understand, the implications were harder to grasp.

When we say that among 13 people at least 2 have the same birth month we are stating an undeniable fact. It is truth, pure and simple. The idea that we can use this kind of slot comparison to determine a statement that is fully truthful, if not precise, is fascinating to me. The implications of knowing truth without being exact have a lot of deeper impact on how we can think and reason.\n",

To know both is to know that when an answer is reached in a problem, it is THE answer.\n",

While the pigeonhole principle may not directly apply to this problem, there can exist a spiritual principle that allows for one to know that there is a higher power.  "

After explaining that if you turn a 'true' answer into a 1 and a 'false' answer into a 0, you can then generate all possible combinations of 6 zeros or ones. He was able to see quickly that that made the answer very simple. He was very impressed with the ability to find that there is an answer to our problem without having to do any outside research besides the population of Idaho. He did say that he may not be able to solve another problem like this by himself, but he does understand the principle. "

We then created bitstrings to represent the total number of answers to the true or false questions and found that there were 64 unique combinations of answers. We found that there are 18,252 total combinations of initials, including people who only have two initials. Multiplying those two numbers together gives the total number of 'holes.'
